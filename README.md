# swashbot

Discord bot that erases messages over time [like gentle beach waves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b44ruhi5ji4).

**Disclaimer**: I am not currently hosting Swashbot on any stable VPS; this is more of a personal project hosted privately, but I think it's cool enough of a project to make this repository public and open source. Maybe in the future I will consider hosting Swashbot for universal use.

## Notes

Interact with Swashbot using some of the commands listed below.

Swashbot does not wash away **pinned messages**.

Requires Python **3.10** or greater.
